# Simple Design System - Astro + Tailwind + PostHog + Cloudflare

## Main Technologies
- Astro
- Tailwind
- Cloudflare Workers
- PostHog

## Other relevant integrations
- mdx
- sitemap
- Playform/Inline

## Quick Start

Deploy now to Cloudflare Workers clicking on the button below:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/copalabs21/template-astro-design-system)


## For local development with VSCode, go to the IDE command line and run:

`git clone <your repo address>`

`cd <the folder name>`

`npm i` to install the packages

`npm run dev` to start the development server

## Domain Configuration
1. Configure the Custom domain on the Cloudflare Dashboard (optional)
2. Configure the Site Domain on astro.config.mjs

## Environment variables
SITE_NAME - The site name

## Motivation
This is a starter template to meet the following requirements:

- A Marketing Website with Landing Pages
- Being an excellent site to recieve traffic from Google and Meta Ads
- Perfect (or almost) score on Google Lighthouse/Page Speed Insights
- Perfect SEO Metatags and ld+json
- Being able to exapand the website and make a blog with thousands of pages.

To achieve this, we're going to use:

- [Posthog](https://posthog.com/) - for Analytics and Sending Events to Meta and Google Ads - Goodbye to GA4 👋.
- Cloudflare Workers - CI/CD solution, alternative to Vercel/Netlify
- Cloudflare Tag Manager - This is a serverless Edge Service that allows you to add 3rd party scripts to your website, thus substituting the need of using Google Tag Manager (or the expensive sGTM solution). If PostHog works good to send data to Meta and GAds, we're not going to need this for now (but it is cool to have this option on the table). 

## Other Important Techs Here
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - The framework used to build the website (Not a JS framework, like react or Vue, but a Site Generator framework).
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

## Remarkable plugins
- notion-astro-loader - Notion loader for the Astro Content Layer
- Playform Inline - inlines your app's critical CSS and lazy-loads the rest.

## Pricing
PostHog is free until 1 million events per month.
Same for Cloudflare Tag Manager.
Cloudflare Workers has an even crazier free tier - the only limitations are: 1 build at a time, 500 builds per month and 100 custom domains per project.

So... well, budget is definitely not an issue here, as it is going to be free for most users. Even when you grow, the price is the most competitive.

## Client-side Iteractivity Frameworks
Sometimes you just don't need it! 

A no-framework approach, for example, is to use the [Web Components Standard.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#web-components-with-custom-elements)

For sharing state between components, [Astro's Nano stores](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/#why-nano-stores) is a good solution.

When things get a little more complex, I like to use Vue or Alpine.

But if you're more a React person, of course you can use this template, but I would advise you to also check other interesting solutions before starting here:
- [Fresh/Deno](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- Next.js/Vercel
- ~stop using react~

If you're going to add some framework integration, always watch the size of the bundle these things add to your cleint-side result, so it doesn't hurt the performance. (React is notorious for this downside.)


## Dark Mode

You can manipulate it by calling these js functions:

- setLightMode()
- setDarkMode()
- respectOSPreference()

You can see the logic at `src/layouts/scripts/darkMode.astro`

## Cool Resources
In the AI era, the resources below are almost useless. Ask Claude Code and you'll have a nice design system out of the box.
Anyway, I'll keep here a list of interesting links (maybe useful for AI)

### Tailwind Component Libraries
- [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/components#marketing)
- [Sailboat](https://sailboatui.com/) - Uses semantic colors (primary and secondary), uses alpine for some components.
- [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/)
- [Tail-kit](https://www.tailwind-kit.com/components#pagesection) - has an interesting live editor
- [Tailkit Free](https://tailkit.com/free-tailwind-components) - yes, it is different from the one above, but almost the same name.
- [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) - Paid - the official UI kit.
